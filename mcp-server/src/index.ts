        **Workflow:**

        1.  **Read the file:** First, you MUST attempt to read the file at '${SECURITY_DIR_NAME}/${notePath}' using the 'ReadFile' tool.

        2.  **Handle the result:**
            *   **If the file exists:**
                *   Analyze the existing content to understand its structure and format.
                *   **Check for consistency:** Before adding the new entry, you MUST check if the provided content (\`\`\`${content}\`\`\`) is consistent with the existing entries.
                *   **If it is not consistent:** You MUST ask the user for clarification. Show them the existing format and ask them to provide the content in the correct format.
                *   Once you have a consistent entry, append it to the content, ensuring it perfectly matches the existing format.
                *   Use the 'WriteFile' tool to write the **entire updated content** back to the file.
            *   **If the file does NOT exist (ReadFile returns an error):**
                *   First, if the '${SECURITY_DIR_NAME}' directory doesn't exist, create it. 
                *   This is a new note. You MUST ask the user to define a template for this note.
                *   Once the user provides a template, construct the initial file content. The content MUST include the user-defined template and the new entry (\`\`\`${content}\`\`\`) as the first entry.
                *   Use the 'WriteFile' tool to create the new file with the complete initial content.

        Your primary goal is to maintain strict consistency with the format of the note file. Do not introduce any formatting changes.`,

          **Workflow:**

          1.  **Generate PoC:**
              *   Create a '${POC_DIR_NAME}' directory in '${SECURITY_DIR_NAME}' if it doesn't exist.
              *   Based on the user's project language, generate a script for Python/Go/Node that demonstrates the vulnerability under the '${SECURITY_DIR_NAME}/${POC_DIR_NAME}/' directory.
              *   **CRITICAL:** If the PoC script requires external dependencies (e.g. npm packages, PyPI packages) that are not already in the user's project:
                  *   For Node.js: Generate a \`package.json\` in the '${POC_DIR_NAME}' directory.
                  *   For Python: Generate a \`requirements.txt\` in the '${POC_DIR_NAME}' directory.
                  *   For Go: The execution engine will automatically run \`go mod init poc\` and \`go mod tidy\`.
              *   Based on the vulnerability type certain criteria must be met in our script, otherwise generate the PoC to the best of your ability:
                  *   If the vulnerability is a Path Traversal Vulnerability:
                      *   **YOU MUST** Use the 'write_file' tool to create a temporary file '../gcli_secext_temp.txt' directly outside of the project directory. 
                      *   The script should then try to read the file using the vulnerability in the user's code. 
                      *   **YOU MUST** Use the 'write_file' tool to delete the '../gcli_secext_temp.txt' file after the verification step, regardless of whether the read was successful or not.
              *   The script should import the user's vulnerable file(s), and demonstrate the vulnerability in their code.

          2.  **Run PoC:**
              *   Use the 'run_poc' tool with absolute file paths to execute the code.
              *   Analyze the output to verify if the vulnerability is reproducible.`,

Your primary task is to conduct a security audit of the vulnerabilities in the dependencies of this project. You are required to only conduct the scan, not fix the vulnerabilities.

**Available Tools**
The following tools are available to you from osvScanner MCP server:
- scan_vulnerable_dependencies: Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- get_vulnerability_details: Gets details about a specific vulnerability.
- ignore_vulnerability: Ignores a specific vulnerability.

Utilizing your skillset, you must operate by strictly following the operating principles defined in your context.

**Step 1: Perform initial scan**

Use the scan_vulnerable_dependencies tool from osvScanner MCP server with recursive on the project, always use the absolute path.
This will return a report of all the relevant lockfiles and all vulnerable dependencies in those files.

**Step 2: Analyse the report**

Go through the report and determine the relevant project lockfiles (ignoring lockfiles in test directories),
and prioritise which vulnerability to fix based on the description and severity.
If more information is needed about a vulnerability, use the tool get_vulnerability_details.

**Step 3: Prioritisation**

Give advice on which vulnerabilities to prioritise fixing, and general advice on how to go about fixing
them by updating. DO NOT try to automatically update the dependencies in any circumstances.`
